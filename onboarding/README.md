# Technical Onboarding

## Executive Summary

Newly-hired communicators, designers, developers, and project managers work on [internal projects](#internal-projects) for their first two weeks to learn the culture, best practices, mentorship, and leadership. We ensure a minimal level of knowledge and skills with tools and technologies relevant to the new-hires’ first assignments (e.g., MacOS, Git, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, NodeJS, React, etc.). Secondary benefits include the following:

- Continues improvement of internal tools
- Immediate socialization of the new-hires beyond their initial team
- Rapid recognition and acceptance of new-hires for their contributions to the internal tools
- Opportunities for existing employees to get experience mentoring, coaching, leading, etc.
- Teaching and demonstrating the culture, values, and practices we **want** the team to have

## The Big Picture

Newly-hired team members join the onboarding team for two one-week sprints. The following table lists what is expected of them during this time.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th width="50%"> New Hires' 1st week </th>
		<th width="50%"> New Hires' 2nd week </th>
	</tr><tr>
		<td colspan=2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Work on bugs/features on internal projects using skills, tools, and practices relevant to their first post-onboarding assignment.
				</li><li>
					Receive help and coaching on skills, tools, and practices to achieve at least minimal level of understanding.
				</li><li>
					Receive assistance, coaching, guidance, etc., from preexisting employees.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td>
			Receive help and coaching from the new-hires in their 2nd week.
		</td><td>
			Help coach and train the first-week cohort.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>


### Exclusions

While this process is driven, in part, by destination team/pod/project needs, it is not meant to handle all its needs. Managers or leads that receive new team members are expected to handle the specific needs of that team/pod/project and client.

For example, Dow Jones projects require team members to have VPN access; the project manager or pod lead is responsible for requesting the new team members' VPN access in advance for it to be ready by the time they start on that project after the onboarding weeks.

### Roles

Beyond the new hire cohorts, the onboarding process involves a variety of related and cooperating roles. A given person may perform several roles during some week, but it is unlikely and discouraged that the onboarding team ever be one single individual.

This section introduces the roles and their functions; later sections provide more details and context.

#### Coach

An employee with specific skills and experience relevant to at least some of the onboarding new hires' position&mdash;for example, QA engineer, iOS developer, Project Manager, web developer, etc.

During any given week, each type of new hire in the cohort must have at least one coach willing and able to help on their projects. The coach ensures the new hire has at least baseline skill with tools, techniques, practices, etc., appropriate to the type of new hire.

When the onboarding team needs to identify a new coach, they rely on appropriate managers&mdash;e.g.,
[Engineering Managers](../engineering-culture/engineering-management-talking-points.md),
Program Managers&mdash;to recommend employees who have already shown competency in both the relevant skills and coaching within their teams. The recommended employee has the final say in whether they are willing and able to commit to coaching for a given week.

See additional [notes](#coaches), below.

#### Coordinator

Provide organizational and logistical support for onboarding level (i.e., not project specific) meetings and activities.

#### Product Owner

Each project used on onboarding must have at least one Owner who holds the vision for the project. Consistent with common Agile practices, the Product Owner activities include the following:

- Help the development team understand the project or feature intent and purpose.
- Provide user stories and negotiates their details with the team.

See additional [notes](#product-owners), below.

#### Project Manager / Agile Coach

An existing Project Manager (PjM) employee. However, when the new hire cohort includes a Project Manager, that person assumes this role with the coaching and guidance of an existing PjM.

#### Volunteer

An existing employee who wishes to participate in an onboarding project. Distinct from [Coaches](#coach), a volunteer's main focus is to gain experience with the tools, languages, etc., used for a project. They also help new hires make progress with a given project.

## Planning

### Physical

When facilities permit, the onboarding cohorts sit in a specific work space close to each other. This is to simulate post-onboarding experience and encourage cohesion during the onboarding process. The space is large enough for two cohorts so that each can remain in one place for both weeks of their onboarding process, and physically near the other cohorts with which it overlaps. The following table describes the place assignment over the weeks.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>Week <em>n    </en></th>
		<th>Week <em>n + 1</en></th>
		<th>Week <em>n + 2</en></th>
	</tr><tr>
		<th>Place "A"</th>
		<td align="center">  &hellip; Cohort <em>n - 1</em></td>
		<td align="center" colspan=2> Cohort <em>n + 1</em></td>
	</tr><tr>
		<th>Place "B"</th>
		<td align="center" colspan=2> Cohort <em>n    </em></td>
		<td align="center"> Cohort <em>n + 2 </em> &hellip;</td>
	</tr>
</table>

To simplify both first-day setup and move-out (see [Transition](#transition)) we pre-provision this area with monitors.

#### Target Team Exception

On occasions, one or more new-hires may arrive just before their first assignment project is scheduled to begin. When this happens, and existing employees with the same assignment are available, it is advantageous to have the existing employees be [Coaches](#coach) or [Volunteers](#volunteer) on the onboarding project. This gives all the opportunity to 'gel' as a team _before_ the assigned project begins.

To support this 'gelling' and simplify post-onboarding [transition](#transition), the onboarding team prefers to seat the 'target team' together in their actual team area rather than the usual [onboarding area](#physical).

### Activity

The goal of each onboarding week is to ensure that the new hires in the cohort are ready to join their initial team/pod/project and the company as a whole.

Once candidates accept their offers and confirm their starting dates, the staffing process begins; it ends with each candidate's project assignment. For details, please see the [Wizeline Staffing Process](https://goo.gl/cY9VIO) document. The importance for onboarding is the set of skills, tools, technologies needed by those destination teams/pods/projects.

The onboarding team uses that list of 'target' skills/tools/technologies to determine which [Internal Projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVNU8hYarb-KgP5O5koll5lMcXMDjbAnkGXnmjVGsaQ/edit#heading=h.xr6r05os2xc3) are best suited for that week’s cohort. The current [list](https://goo.gl/CuZVPl) is from late 2016; as the number of active projects grows and their needs change, we need a more dynamic and responsive method of tracking this information.

Next, the onboarding team works with the internal projects’ owners to move items both valuable to the projects and relevant to the onboarding goals to the top of the backlogs. This is a weekly activity, taking into account both the upcoming and the in-progress cohorts.

If the internal projects’ owners are new to the onboarding process, those more experienced with the process help orient them to the process, educational goals and methods, etc. For additional notes, see [Product Owners](#product-owners).

The final planning step is to determine what additional resources the cohort will need to be successful with their tasks during the onboarding weeks. At a minimum, owners/stakeholders for the internal projects need to be available to answer questions, discuss requirements and alternatives, etc. Additionally, onboarding cohorts may require additional skills beyond those present in the cohort. For example:

- Project management
- Front-end, back-end, or mobile development
- Visual or UX design
- Documentation or technical communication

### “Internal Projects?”

A separate initiative is underway to identify and develop ideas for internal projects:

- [Google document](https://goo.gl/07IbM8)
- [Jira Board](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=WIP&rapidView=28)
- [Confluence Board](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/wiki/display/WIP)

Existing staff members with ideas and "passion" for these projects serve as product owners for these projects&mdash;essentially, the “clients” for the new hires cohort.

Each of these internal projects should be implemented using the most appropriate tools and technologies. Ideally, most tools and technologies used across the platform and services teams are represented in the internal projects. To lend value to the projects’ use in the onboarding process, we ask that the process for selecting tools and technologies for not-yet-started projects include this desire for broad coverage.

These projects’ owners are expected to maintain a backlog of desired features, bug fixes, etc. To encourage discussionand participatory “investment” on the part of new hires, these backlog items should have only enough information and detail to begin conversations, but not enough to be simply “recipes” requiring little creative decision-making.

## Execution

- New cohorts begin each Monday.
- Their new MacBooks should be available and ready for setup.
- HR provides orientation information and support.
- New hires who will participate in the onboarding program are placed in the new hires area when available; see [Planning - Physical](#physical). 
- They do not receive their monitors until they complete their onboarding process and move to their initial team/assignment area; see [Transition](#transition).
- Initial meetings with the previous cohort, [internal project owners](#product-owner), etc., are scheduled.
- Classroom sessions on specific skills, tools, technologies, etc., are be scheduled and held as needed.

### Basic Syllabus

As described [previously](#activity), much of the material is tailored to and driven by the new hires’ initial assignments. However, some topics and material are common to all.

After the HR orientation, the initial technical onboarding session includes the following:

- Overview of the technical onboarding program (purpose, duration, structure, etc.)
- Introduction to the project(s)
- Access to project materials
  - Jira and GitHub
	  - Create account if needed
     - Access to the Wizeline organization
     - ssh keys, 2-Factor Authorization, etc.
- Slack
	- Onboarding dev team(s)
	- “Basic” company/office channels
	- How to preview and join other existing channels
- Other team/engineering/company information
	- Google Drive
	- [wize-docs](../README.md) GitHub repo & wiki
- Specific work items on the selected [project(s)](https://goo.gl/07IbM8)
	- User Stories 
	- Bugs

All along the way, the [Coaches](#coach) ask what level of knowledge and familiarity the new hires have with the various topics. When one or more new hires need specific help, the onboarding team provides the information needed in this preferred order:

1. Other new hires&mdash;whether junior or senior&mdash;with supervision to ensure that the coaching is consistent with Wizeline practices and procedures.
2. Onboarding staff directly.

### Suggested / Expected Meetings

Assuming normal 5-day work weeks, each week of involvement includes meetings over 6 work days, Monday to Monday:

#### Onboarding Kick-off

Scheduled and run by the [Project Manager / Agile Coach](#project-manager--agile-coach). The agenda includes:

- Explain onboarding purpose, structure, etc.
- For each project
  - High-level introduction
  - Demonstrate current state
  - Express sprint goals briefly
- Ensure basic computer setup
- Ensure access to JIRA, GitHub, etc.
- Slack
  - Basic introduction
  - Ensure membership in "basic" channels

#### Per Project Sprint Planning / Kick-off

Scheduled and run by the [Project Manager / Agile Coach](#project-manager--agile-coach). This meeting may be either Monday afternoon, e.g., following the Onboarding Kick-off, or Tuesday morning, instead of that day's Standup. The agenda includes:

- Sprint planning
  - Flesh out story(ies)
  - As appropriate, define and assign Tasks
- Project-specific tools & environment setup

#### Daily Standup

Scheduled and run by the [Project Manager / Agile Coach](#project-manager--agile-coach). The highlights include:

- Focus on the Team: Yesterday/Today/Blockers.
- [Coaches](#coach) are encouraged to attend, but more to observe and inform their coaching than to participate.
- [Product Owners](#product-owner) may attend but should expect only to observe rather than participate.

#### Plan

Scheduled and run by the [Coordinator](#coordinator). Ideally, the Staffing Manager provides basic information about the next week's new hires _before_ this meeting so that appropriate projects and [Coaches](#coach) can be identified and attend this meeting. The agenda includes:

- Staffing Manager provides information on next week's new hires
  - Experience summary
  - Concerns expressed during interview process
- Orient new [Coaches](#coach) as needed
- [Coaches](#coach) and [product owners](#product-owner) select user stories from the project backlog
- Discuss needs, risks, etc.


#### Preparation and Demo

Scheduled and facilitated by the [Coordinator](#coordinator). A quick technical rehearsal before the Demo. The highlights include:

- Generally led by the [Project Manager / Agile Coach](#project-manager--agile-coach)
- Explain the onboarding framework briefly
- Explain and demonstrate each project's progress

#### Retrospective

Scheduled and run by the [Project Manager / Agile Coach](#project-manager--agile-coach). It is focused on overall onboarding rather than the specific projects. The main questions to discuss are the following:

- What went well?
- What can we improve?
- What do we do?

## (Re-)Initialization

The first cohort through this process received more coaching and training support from existing employees during their first week, rather than a prior cohort (9 - 13 Jan., 2017).

On occasion, there may be weeks when there is no new cohort (e.g., all technical new-hires must join their assigned team/pod/project immediately; no technical new-hires; etc.).

- The previous cohort completes their 2nd week as able (e.g., perhaps some members join their first assignments after only 1 onboarding week)
- When a new cohort is available, they will start as if in the initial cohort without 2nd week “seniors” as explained above

## Transition

Just before each week’s TGIF, the combined new hire cohorts demonstrate their **visible progress** on the internal projects to interested parties &mdash; whether physically or via Hangout.

Each week’s new hires are publicly introduced to the rest of the team during TGIF.

Members of the senior cohort, i.e., 2nd-week, move their MacBook and personal effects (leaving the temporary monitor) to their initial team/assignment area. They also receive their monitors at this time. All this so that their space will be available for the new junior cohort that begins the following week&hellip;

![The Circle of Life](images/circle-of-life.jpg)

## Iteration and Evolution

As the company grows and the needs and culture change, the onboarding process must change too. Continuous feedback from various sources is key to keeping the program focused on improving and producing the correct baseline experiences.

Feedback sources:

- Participants&mdash;during and for weeks after their onboarding process
   - Did the program prepare you for your initial team/pod/project?
   - Did you learn and adjust to the company culture?
   - What did we get wrong? e.g., what did you have to “unlearn” later?
   - What did we miss?

- Pod/team/project leads and project managers
	- Are new hires adequately prepared for team/pod/project-specific onboarding after their 2-week process?

- Engineering managers
	- Are new hires being enculturated correctly?
	- What onboarding is done by several teams/pods/projects that this program could centralize?

## Additional Notes

### All 

Make every interaction with the new hires as safe as possible for them to admit ignorance or inexperience. Encourage questions and reward them with positive feedback.

### Coaches

- When discussing any given technical aspect of your project or its development, please ask the new hires how familiar they are. Be prepared to provide education on any given topic no matter how eager you are to make progress on the project.
- Leverage any and all available expertise for coaching the new hires.

### Product Owners

- As noted [before](#internal-projects), internal projects should be developed using appropriate tools, frameworks, etc. However, when several suitable options are available, give preference to combinations not already in use by other projects. This is to maintain coverage of tools and technologies in use in platform and services.
- Be more “client” or “product owner” and less “architect” or “lead engineer.”
   - Explain stories, goals, values, etc.
   - Be open to new/different ideas, approaches, etc.
   - Leave opportunities for creative input and decision-making at all levels, e.g., from user experience to architecture coding. Create opportunities for the new hires to feel empowered, trusted, respected, invested, etc.
- Think widely and creatively for onboarding and educational opportunities in your projects
   - Web
   - Mobile
   - Design
   - Documentation
   - Testing
   - &hellip;?
