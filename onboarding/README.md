# Engineering Onboarding in GDL

## Executive Summary

Newly-hired software engineers and project managers work on [internal projects](#internal-projects) for their first 2 weeks to learn culture, best practices, and leader/mentorship while ensuring a minimal level of knowledge and skills with tools/technologies relevant to the new-hires’ first assignments (_e.g._, MacOS, Git, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, NodeJS, React, _etc._). Secondary benefits (hopefully) include&hellip;

- ever-more-valuable internal tools
- immediate socialization of the new-hires beyond their initial assignment team
- (more) rapid recognition and “acceptance” of new-hires for their contributions to the internal tools
- opportunities for existing employees to get experience mentoring, coaching, leading, _etc_.
- teaching and demonstrating the culture, values, and practices we **want** the team to have

## The Big Picture

Newly-hired communicators, designers, developers, and project managers  join the “onboarding” team for two 1-week “sprints.”

</table>

### Exclusions

While this process is driven, in part, by destination team/pod/project needs, it is not meant to handle all such needs. Team/pod/project-leads and project managers are expected to handle needs specific to that team/pod/project and/or client.

For example, Dow Jones projects require team members to have VPN access; the project manager and/or pod lead continue to be responsible for requesting the new team member’s VPN access sufficiently in advance for it to be ready and available by the time the new team member actually starts on that project after the onboarding experience.

### Roles

Beyond the new-hire cohorts, the onboarding process involves requires a variety of related and cooperating roles. A given person may perform several roles during some week, but it is unlikely (and discouraged) that the onboarding "team" ever be one single individual.

This section is intended to introduce the roles and their functions; later sections will provide more detail and context.

#### Coach

An experienced employee with specific skills and experience relevant to at least some of the onboarding new-hires' position &mdash; for example, QA engineer, iOS developer, Project Manager, web developer, _etc_.

During any given week, each "type" of new-hire in the cohort must have at least one Coach willing and able to help the new-hires work on the project(s) and ensure they have at least "baseline" skill with tools, techniques, practices, _etc_., appropriate to that "type."

#### Coordinator

Provide organizational and logistical support for onboarding-level (_i.e._, not project-specific) meetings and activities.

#### Product Owner

Each project used during onboarding must have at least one Owner who holds the "vision" for the project. Consistent with common "agile" practices, this Product Owner

- Helps the development team understand project/feature intent and purpose
- Provides User Stories and negotiates their details with the team

#### Project Manager / Agile Coach

Generally an existing Project Manager (PjM) employee. When the new-hire cohort includes a new Project Manager, however, that new-hire assumes this role with the coaching and guidance of an existing PjM.

## Planning

### Physical

When space, desks, facilities, _etc_., permit, the onboarding cohorts are placed in a specific work space close to each other. This is to simulate post-onboarding experience and encourage cohesion during the onboarding process. This space is large enough for 2 cohorts so that each can remain in one place for both weeks of its onboarding process, and physically near the other cohorts with which it overlaps:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>Week <em>n    </en></th>
		<th>Week <em>n + 1</en></th>
		<th>Week <em>n + 2</en></th>
	</tr><tr>
		<th>Place "A"</th>
		<td align="center">  &hellip; Cohort <em>n - 1</em></td>
		<td align="center" colspan=2> Cohort <em>n + 1</em></td>
	</tr><tr>
		<th>Place "B"</th>
		<td align="center" colspan=2> Cohort <em>n    </em></td>
		<td align="center">  &hellip; Cohort <em>n + 2</em></td>
	</tr>
</table>

To simplify both first day setup and move-out (see [Transition](#transition), below) we pre-provision this area with monitors.

### Activity

The goal of each onboarding week is to ensure that the new-hires in the cohort are ready to join their initial team/pod/project and the company as a whole.

Once candidates accept their offers and confirm their starting dates, the staffing process begins; it ends with each candidate's project assignment. For details, please refer to the [Wizeline Staffing Process](https://goo.gl/cY9VIO) document; what is important for onboarding is the set of skills, tools, technologies needed by those destination teams/pods/projects.

The onboarding team uses that list of ‘target’ skills/tools/technologies to determine which [Internal Project(s)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVNU8hYarb-KgP5O5koll5lMcXMDjbAnkGXnmjVGsaQ/edit#heading=h.xr6r05os2xc3) are best suited for that week’s cohort. At present, we have [this list](https://goo.gl/CuZVPl) from late 2016; as the number of active projects grows and their needs change, we will need a more dynamic and responsive method of tracking this information.

Next, the onboarding team works with the identified Internal Projects’ “owner(s)” to move items both valuable to the project(s) and relevant to the onboarding goals to the top of the backlog(s). This is a weekly activity, taking into account both upcoming cohorts and the in-progress cohorts’ expected progress.

If the Internal Projects’ “owner(s)” are new to the onboarding process, those more experienced with the process help orient them to the process, educational goals and methods, _etc._ (see [Notes for Project “Owners” / “Champions”](#notes-for-project-owners--champions), below).

The final planning step is to determine what additional resources the cohort will need to be successful with their tasks during the onboarding weeks. At a minimum, Owners/Stakeholders for the Internal Project(s) will need to be available to answer questions, discuss requirements and alternatives, _etc._ Additionally, onboarding cohorts may require additional skills beyond those present in the cohort &mdash; _e.g._,

- Project management
- Front-end, back-end, and/or mobile development
- Visual and/or UX design
- Documentation / technical communication

### “Internal Projects?”

A separate initiative is underway to identify and develop ideas for internal projects:

- [\#internal-projects](https://wizeline.slack.com/archives/internal-projects) Slack channel
- [Google document](https://goo.gl/07IbM8)
- [Jira Board](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=WIP&rapidView=28)
- [Confluence Board](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/wiki/display/WIP)
- [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dhDp6GLV/v-team-projects) for tracking assignments & checklists

Existing staff members with ideas and “passion” for these projects serve as “product owners”/“on-site customers” for these projects &mdash; essentially the “clients” for the new-hire teams.

Each of these internal projects should be implemented using the most appropriate tools and technologies, of course. Ideally, “most” tools and technologies used across the Platform and Services teams are represented in the internal projects. To lend value to the projects’ use in the onboarding process, we ask that the process for selecting tools and technologies for not-yet-started projects include this desire for “broad coverage.”

These projects’ “owners” are expected to maintain a “backlog” of desired features, bug fixes, _etc._, &mdash; _e.g._, GitHub project(s), Jira issues, _etc._ In order to encourage discussion and, perhaps, some amount of participatory “investment” on the part of new-hires, these backlog items should have only “enough” information and detail to begin conversations, but not enough to be simply “recipes” requiring little creative decision-making.

## Execution

- New cohorts generally begin each Monday
- Their new MacBooks should be available and ready for setup
- HR provides orientation information and support
- New-hires who will participate in this onboarding program are placed in the “new-hires” area (when available; see [Planning - Physical](#physical), above; their orientation sets the expectation of moving to be with/near their initial assignment team after the 2-week onboarding process
- They do not receive "their" monitors until they complete their onboarding process and move to their initial team/assignment area (see [Transition](#transition), below)
- Initial meetings with the previous cohort, “(internal) project/product owner(s),” _etc._, are scheduled
- “Classroom” sessions on specific skills, tools, technologies, _etc._, are be scheduled and held as needed

### Basic Syllabus

As described [above](#activity), much of the material is tailored to and driven by the new-hires’ initial assignments. However, some topics and material are common to all.

After the HR orientation, _etc._, the initial “technical onboarding” session includes

- Overview of this technical onboarding program (purpose, duration, structure, etc.)
- Introduction to the project(s)
- Access to project materials &mdash; _e.g._,
  - Jira and/or GitHub
	  - create account if needed
     - access to the Wizeline organization
     - ssh keys, 2-Factor Authorization, _etc._
- Slack
	- Onboarding dev team(s)
	- “Basic” company/office channels
	- How to preview and, if desired, join other existing channels
- Other team / engineering / company information &mdash; _e.g._,
	- Google Drive
	- [wize-docs](../README.md) GitHub repo & wiki
	- _etc._
- Specific work items &mdash; User Stories and/or bugs &mdash; on the selected [project(s)](https://goo.gl/07IbM8)

All along the way, the coaches / teachers / mentors ask what level of knowledge and familiarity the new-hires have with the various topics, how to do it on MacOS, _etc._ When one or more new-hires need specific help, the onboarding team provides the information needed in this preferred order:

- Other new-hires &mdash; whether “junior” or “senior” &mdash;  with “supervision” to ensure that the coaching is consistent with Wizeline practices and procedures
- Onboarding staff directly

### Suggested / Expected Meetings

Assuming normal 5-day work weeks, each week of involvement includes meetings over 6 work days (Monday to Monday):

(scroll horizontally if/as needed to see the whole schedule)

#### Onboarding Kick-off

- Explain onboarding purpose, structure, _etc_.
- For each project
  - High-level introduction
  - Demonstrate current state
  - Briefly express sprint goals / "theme"
- Ensure basic computer setup
- Ensure access to JIRA, GitHub, _etc_.
- Slack
  - Basic introduction
  - Ensure membership in 'basic' channels

#### Per Project Sprint Planning / Kick-off

This meeting may be either Monday afternoon (_e.g._, part of or following the Onboarding Kick-off) or Tuesday morning (in lieu of that day's Standup), according to schedules and availability.

- "Normal" Sprint planning
  - Flesh out story(ies)
  - As appropriate, define and assign Tasks
- Project-specific tools & environment setup

#### Daily Standup

- Run by the [Project Manager / Agile Coach](#project-manager--agile-coach)
- Focused on the Team &mdash; Yesterday / Today / Blockers
- Coaches are encouraged to attend, but more to observe and inform their coaching than participate
- [Product Owner(s)](#product-owner) may attend, but should expect only to observe rather than participate

#### Plan

Ideally, the Staffing Manager has provided basic information about the next week's new-hires &mdash; at least name and initial assignment &mdash; enough _before_ this meeting so that appropriate project(s) and Coaches can be identified and attend this meeting.

- Staffing Manager provides information on next week's new-hires
  - Experience summary
  - Concerns expressed during interview process
- Orient new Coaches if/as needed
- Coaches and Product Owner(s) select User Story(ies) from the project backlog(s)
- Discuss needs, risks, _etc._


#### Preparation & Demo

A quick "technical rehearsal" before the Demo.

The Demonstration:

- Led by the [Project Manager / Agile Coach](#project-manager--agile-coach) new-hire(s), if there are any
- Briefly explain the onboarding framework
- Explain and demonstrate each project's progress

#### Retrospective

"What went well?" / "What can we improve?" focused more on overall onboarding rather than the specific project(s).

## (Re-)Initialization

The first cohort through this process received more coaching and training support from existing employees during their first week, rather than a prior cohort (9 - 13 Jan., 2017).

On occasion, there may be weeks when there is no new cohort (_e.g._, all technical new-hires must join their assigned team/pod/project immediately; no technical new-hires; _etc._).

- The previous cohort completes their 2nd week as able (_e.g._, perhaps some members join their first assignments after only 1 onboarding week)
- When a new cohort is available, they will start as if in the initial cohort without 2nd week “seniors” as explained above

## Transition

Just prior to each week’s TGIF in GDL, the combined new-hire cohorts demonstrate their **visible progress** on the Internal Project(s) to interested parties &mdash; whether physically in GDL or via Hangout.

Each week’s new-hires are publicly introduced to the rest of the GDL team during TGIF.

Members of the “senior” (_i.e._, 2nd-week) cohort move their MacBook and personal effects (leaving the monitor) out of the “onboarding teams area” to their initial team/assignment area. They also receive their monitors at this time. All this so that their space will be available for the new “junior” cohort that will begin the following week&hellip;

![The Circle of Life](images/circle-of-life.jpg)

## Iteration and Evolution

As the company grows and the needs and culture change, the onboarding process must change, too. Continuous feedback from various sources are key to keeping the program focused on improving and producing the correct baseline experiences.

Feedback sources:

- Participants &mdash; during and for weeks (months?) after their onboarding process<br>
  Did the program prepare you for&hellip;

   - your initial team/pod/project?
   - company culture, _etc_?

  What did we get “wrong” &mdash; _e.g._, what did you have to “unlearn” later?<br>
  What did we “miss” (that is not “too” specific to your initial team/pod/project)?

- Pod/team/project leads & Project managers

  Are new-hires adequately prepared for team/pod/project-specific onboarding after their 2-week process?

- Engineering managers

  Are new-hires being inculturated “correctly?"<br>
  What onboarding is done by several teams/pods/projects that this program could "centralize?"

## Notes for Project “Owners” / “Champions”

- As noted [above](#internal-projects), Internal Projects should be developed using appropriate tools, frameworks, _etc._, to be successful. However, when several suitable options are available, give preference to items/combinations not already in use by other projects so as to maintain “coverage” of tools, technologies, _etc._, in use in platform and services.
- Make every interaction with the new-hires as “safe” for them to admit ignorance/inexperience as possible. Encourage questions and “reward” them with positive feedback.
- When discussing any given technical aspect of your project or its development, please ask the new-hires how familiar they are. Be prepared to provide education on any given topic — no matter how eager you are to make progress on the project.
- Leverage any and all available expertise for teaching/coaching the new-hires: you, other “experienced” employees, one or more of the new-hires themselves, etc.
- As much as possible, be more “customer/client” or “Product Owner” and less “architect” or “lead engineer”
   - Explain stories, goals, values, _etc._
   - Be open to new/different ideas, approaches, _etc._
   - Leave as many opportunities for creative input and decision-making at all levels (_e.g._, from user experience to coding) as possible to create as many opportunities for the new-hires to feel empowered, trusted, respected, invested, _etc._
- Think as “widely” and creatively as possible for onboarding & educational opportunities in your project(s)
   - Web
   - Mobile
   - Design
   - Documentation
   - Testing
   - &hellip;?
