# Onboarding

Learning everything you need to know as a new employee can be as stressful as trying to remember everything you want and need to share with a new employee / team member.

Use [Issues](https://github.com/wizeservices/wize-docs/issues) to create checklists.

Build the Issue's checklist from 'templates' collected in the [wiki](https://github.com/wizeservices/wize-docs/wiki/Onboarding-Checklists). Organize the templates by 'subject' so they can be mixed-and-matched to create a the "right" checklist for the new employee / team member. _E.g._,

- General company information &mdash; history, office practices, _etc_.
- Product
  - Common Practices & Standards
  - Engineering
     - Front-end
     - Backend
     - DevOps
  - Design
  - _etc_.
- Services
  - Common Practices & Standards
  - DevNet
  - MPP
  - _etc_.
- Recruiting
- ...

Assign the Issue to a 'mentor' employee &mdash; the prime contact for helping the new employee / team member...

- understand the checklist
- find the right resources, meet the right people, _etc_., for working through it (_i.e._, the mentor will not necessarily directly help with each and every item)
