**What's incident management?** (super important)

Is the practice of restoring services as quickly as possible after an incident (reactive)

* Detecting and recording incident details
* Matching incidents against known problems
* Resolving incidents as quickly as possible
* Prioritizing incidents in terms of impact and urgency
* Escalating incidents to other teams to ensure timely resolution
* Effective communication between affected parties

**Whats Problem Management?**

* The primary objective is to prevent Incidents from happening(proactive) and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. 
* Analyze Incident Records, and use data collected by other IT Service Management processes to identify trends or significant Problems.
  * Problem detection
  * Problem logging
  * Investigation & diagnosis
  * Resolution â€“ workaround or permanent
  * Closure

**What is an SLA?**
Service level agreement: Is a contract between the customers of an organization and the organization itself. The customers can be external, or even internal. The service level agreement informs the user what they can expect with regards to IT technology uptime and response time.

**What is an SLO(service-level objective)**

Is a key element of a service-level agreement (SLA) between a service provider and a customer. SLOs are agreed upon as a means of measuring the performance of the Service Provider and are outlined as a way of avoiding disputes between the two parties based on a misunderstanding.
Difference between SLA and SLO
The SLA is the entire agreement that specifies what service is to be provided, how it is supported, times, locations, costs, performance, and responsibilities of the parties involved. SLOs are specific measurable characteristics of the SLA such as availability, throughput, frequency, response time, or quality.

**What is the Change management process?**
Change management consists of several individuals/process who highlight and approve changes that are to be implemented on to the system.
It helps the involved parties review the potential changes and check whether the changes have the potential to cause any negative effect on the overall system.

**What is an RCA process?**
The goal of the RCA(root cause analysis) process is to understand what went wrong and to accurately report the impact of the incident and or failed change so that the results are understood and that a similar incident can be avoided in the future

**What are some techniques or tools used for RCA?**
5 Whys
* Kepner Tregoe Problem Analysis
* Ishikawa / Fishbone / Cause and Effect Analysis
* Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
* Pareto Analysis (80/20 principle)
