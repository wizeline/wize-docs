Currently we have a monolith application, code is a mess and all coupled, the application has a really bad performance and is hard to debug.
What process or series of steps would you propose to improve the application, the code, and the performance.
Expewcted answers:
- list of steps to assess, measure, redesign, planning for the improvements and deployment.
- list of key questions for the development team: how does your architecture look, how is your code review process, what is the skill level of the team.
- continue improvement process and supporting processes as QA
This question in very broad but we are interested in the process not the concrete tasks.

What research and possible changes do we need to do to expand our aplication in
