# Make substring!

## Interviewer Statement

```
// Write a function to determine whether an input string x is a substring of another input string y.
// For example...
// ("bat", "abate") => true
// ("bat", "beat")  => false
```

## Observations
- 20 mins FOR AN EXPERIENCED, 40 mins FOR ROOKIE
- Basically implement something similar string.substring without using this function or any other similar function (string.find, string.contains, etc).
- Minus points if the candidate uses string functions

## Other test cases
Once the candidate has a solution, perhaps ask what other kinds of test cases / input they would use. Share these only if the candidate doesn't identify them â€” especially if the proposed solution wouldn't handle them!

### 'Substring' is longer than the 'superstring'

```
// ("bat", "ba") => false
```

### Non-strings

If the candidate's chosen language has dynamic typing &mdash; _e.g._, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, _etc._

- does the candidate consider non-string input? _e.g._,

```
// ("bat", 0)    => ?
// (null, "bat") => ?
// ({}, [])      => ?
```

  - what do they think should happen? why?
    - raise error / throw exception?
    - simply return false?
    - other idea(s)?

At least to see how the candidate thinks through/about it; if there's enough time, giving another problem might be more interesting and informative than actually coding these details.
