## Interviewer Statement
```
// Write a function that implements a queue using any data structure. Include functionality to enqueue and dequeue a value from the queue.
```

## Observations
- 15 mins FOR AN EXPERIENCED, 30 mins FOR ROOKIE
- How it should be resolved:
```python
def my_queue(action, value):
  #Logic to choose the action.

def enqueue(value):
  #Logic to add value

def dequeue():
  #Logic to remove last inserted value

def size():
  #Logic to calculate the queue's size
```
