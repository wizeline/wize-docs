# Matrix Product

Write a function to solve the problem between 2 matrices. Matrices could be any size, not necessarily a square.

## Problem observations
- Make sure that you consider the case where you cannot get the product of a pair of matrices. Example
```
1 2 3     7   8    (1 * 7) + (2 * 9) + (3 * 11)   (1 * 8) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 12)
       X  9   10 = 
4 5 6     11  12   (4 * 7) + (5 * 9) + (6 * 11)   (4 * 8) + (5 * 10) + (6 * 12)
```

## Function prototype
```javascript
function mutiplicateMatrix(a, b) {
  // Code here
}
```
