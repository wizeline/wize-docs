Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with the following conditions:
- For multiples of three [3] print “Wize” instead of the number.
- For the multiples of five [5] print “Services” instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three [3] and five[5] print “WizeServices” instead of the number.
