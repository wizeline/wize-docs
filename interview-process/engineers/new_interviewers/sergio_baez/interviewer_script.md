## Introduction

Hi! Nice to meet you.  My name is Sergio and I'm a Sotfware Engineer.
This interview will take about 1hour where you'll solve some programming questions
and at the end there will be a Q&A where you can ask me about me or the company.

## Focus and Evaluation

The focus of this interview is how well you work with data structures, algorithms
and you coding skill 

## Opening Questions

Before we begin with the fun part, tell me:
- Why are you considering on a career change?
- Are you working on personal projects.

## Questions

- Repeated letters: This problem is fairly easy which it needs to use a hash map and assing each letter the index and then sort the by that index, and the letter representing the lower index is the first non repeated. Code is in the same directory.

- Brackets: The solution for this problem is using a stack, you push the opening brackets and when you a closing one you pop and compare if the popped one is a closing one you continue and if not return false.

## Candidate questions

Do you have any questions for me?

## Closing

Thanks for everythin and I'll let know the talent aquisition team what comes next.
