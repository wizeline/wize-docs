# Recommendations for the On-site Coaches

- Before the candidate starts solving the challenge, ensure you:

1. Give the Wifi password to the candidate.
2. Explain the challenge to the candidate.
3. Make the following recommendations:

    - To use any tools, languages, frameworks, or databases they like.
    - Search on the web for any resources they need.
    - Ask any team members for help.
    - Not to invest much time on any given problem before asking for help.

- Check on the candidate every 45 minutes and ask the following questions:
    - How is it going?
    - What is working yet?
    - Is there anything you need?
    
- Observe the following:
  - Does it seem like they'll finish the challenge? At least in some part?
  - Are they stuck on something and, perhaps, shy to ask for help?
  - How do they handle interruptions, unsolicited interactions, _etc_?
  
- Make sure they know how much time is left; offer additional time if it might help.
  _e.g._, if _almost done_ with a last feature or detail, delay lunch by 15-30 minutes.
- Offer the candidate snacks, water, coffee, _etc._
