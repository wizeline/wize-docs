# Comments App Challenge

This is a *guide* for presenting the challenge to the candidate, *not* a document to give to the candidate.

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to create a Comments app connected to a RESTful API.

Example: [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11846108)

## Requirements

These are the minimum app requirements:

- Create a comment based on a text and a username.
- Reply to a comment based on a text and a username.
- Generate a unique identifier for each comment (permalink).
- Show a single comment.
- Retrieve comments from single user.
- Delete all comments from a single user.
- Delete single comment from the list.
- Search comments across the database.
- Access to a RESTful API.

**Note:** Authentication is not required nor encouraged.

## Bonus Points

- Add profile image for user, retrieved as an url or using any other method.
- Flag a comment to hide it.
- Use git and have a GitHub repository.
- Have a live version of the application (deploy).

## Design Discussion

- Discuss the appropriate tools, frameworks, _etc_., to implement the server backend. 
- Talk through the system design:
    - Database design for deleted and nested comments.
    - Nested comments view.
    - Permalinks generation.

## Presentation Questions

### General

- Why did you choose this framework/library?
- What features of this framework/library are most important to you?

### Challenge Specific

- How do you handle in the DB a deleted comment? How you display a deleted comment?
- How you generated the permalink of each comment?

# Recommendations for the On-site Coaches

- Before the candidate starts solving the challenge, ensure you:

1. Give the Wifi password to the candidate.
2. Explain the challenge to the candidate.
3. Make the following recommendations:

    - To use any tools, languages, frameworks, or databases they like.
    - Search on the web for any resources they need.
    - Ask any team members for help.
    - Not to invest much time on any given problem before asking for help.

- Check on the candidate every 45 minutes and ask the following questions:
    - How is it going?
    - What is working yet?
    - Is there anything you need?

- Observe the following:
  - Does it seem like they'll finish the challenge? At least in some part?
  - Are they stuck on something and, perhaps, shy to ask for help?
  - How do they handle interruptions, unsolicited interactions, _etc_?

- Make sure they know how much time is left; offer additional time if it might help.
  _e.g._, if _almost done_ with a last feature or detail, delay lunch by 15-30 minutes.
- Offer the candidate snacks, water, coffee, _etc._
