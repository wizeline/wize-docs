# Developer On-Site Interviews

Candidates who do well in the [phone screens](../README.md) are invited for an on-site interview. In 'special' cases&mdash;_e.g._, due to travel distance and expense&mdash;this is done remotely rather than strictly "on-site."

This is team members' **best and last opportunity** to form a **strong opinion** as to
**whether or not** they **want to work with the candidate**.

This is **expensive** in both time and money &mdash; _e.g._, travel, away from work/projects, _etc_. &mdash;
for both the **team and candidate**. The result can be **life-changing** for both the candidate and the team.

## Please...

- **read** the information and comments on the candidate in [Greenhouse](https://app.greenhouse.io)&mdash; you might find something you want to ask the candidate about!
- **talk** with the candidate if/when given the opportunity
- **help** the candidate if/when needed during their on-site challenge
- **ask** meaningful questions &mdash; even if you may not be in the final de-brief, the candidate's response to your question
  may help another team member form their **strong opinion**
- **focus** when interacting with the candidate &mdash; _e.g._, please avoid "inside jokes" and conversations that may
  exclude the candidate

### Especially during the Candidate's Presentation, Please...

- **be present** &mdash; _e.g._, avoid focusing on your laptop, other work, Slack, _etc_.
- **respect** the candidate's time, effort, and pressure &mdash; even if you have seen it hundreds of times before,
it's (hopefully!) new and stressful to them
- **move on** &mdash; don't spend too much time on any one question or issue<br/>
- **learn** what the candidate does/not know; many candidates do not want/like to say, "I don't know."
  If when they do, please...

  - **understand** how difficult it may have been for the candidate to admit that
  - **assume** you have **found the limit** of their knowledge on this topic
  - **resist** the urge to show what else you know about the topic

## When in doubt

**Remember** when **you were a candidate** and do what **you would want/hope** the team to do with/for you.
