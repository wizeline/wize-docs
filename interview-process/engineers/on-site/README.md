# Developer On-Site Interviews

Candidates who do well in the [phone screens](../README.md) are invited for an on-site interview. In 'special' cases&mdash;_e.g._, due to travel distance and expense&mdash;this is done remotely rather than strictly "on-site."

This is team members' **best and last opportunity** to form a **strong opinion** as to
**whether or not** they **want to work with the candidate**.

## Challenges

- [Chess](chess.md)
- [TinyURL](tiny-url-challenge.md)

### Have an Idea for a New One?

To add a new on-site challenge use [this template](challenge.template.md): replace the quoted text with the challenge specific information and create a Pull Request.

## Flow

As part of scheduling the interview, the recruiting team tells the candidate their final interview will include developing a project. Without receiving any real specifics, the candidate makes 2 choices:

- type: web or non-web
- format: [2-part](#2-part) "prepare in advance" (preferred) or [4-hour](#4-hour) "all during the interview"

### 2-part

#### Preparation

Some days in advance of their interview, we

- give them "basic" project requirements
- encourage them to ask questions
- allow them to use any tools, languages, frameworks, _etc_., they like
- ask them to keep a work journal for tracking activities not directly reflected in SCCS commits/checkins (_e.g._, thinking, research, _etc_.)
- advise them to be prepared to present their solution &mdash; including design choices/trade-offs, commit/development history, _etc._

_Giving the candidate some_ minimum _number of days to prepare is more important than restricting it to some_ maximum: _how they manage their time implementing the initial project can be an interesting and important part of the interview_.

#### Interview Day

During their actual interview:

- an initial ~60 min. session during which
  - the candidate
     - demonstrates their project
     - presents and discusses
         - their design
         - the choices they made in arriving at it
         - their code
         - how they managed their time and worked on the project within their personal constraints (_i.e._, the "work journal" mentioned above and commit/checkin log)
  - the interview team
     - asks questions focused on the project and process

         _i.e._, save "broader," "tell us about yourself," "soft skills," _etc_., questions for the 2nd presentation (below)
       
     - decides on new/changed requirements (generally based on the state of the project, its design choices, _etc_.) and presents them to the candidate
     - allows the candidate 10-15 minutes solo thinking time if that is the candidate's preference
   - team and candidate discuss ideas and designs for the new requirements, with the team acting as a combination of both client/stakeholder and the candidate's team

- 2.5 to 3 hours for the candidate to work on the changes

  - offer snacks, water, coffee, _etc._
  - check on the candidate every 45 minutes or so
     - _e.g._, "how is it going?" "do you need anything?" _etc_.
     - are they stuck on something and, perhaps, afraid(?) to ask for help?
     - how do they handle interruptions, unsolicited interactions, _etc_?
 - make sure they know how much time is left; offer additional time if it might help

     _e.g._, if _almost done_ with a last feature or detail, delay lunch by 15-30 minutes

- 60 min. final presentation:
  - the candidate demonstrates and presents their changes
  - Q & A: not limited to the project

If the candidate made their project repository public in order to share it with the team, ask/remind them at or after the end of the 2nd presentation to either delete it, or at least make it private.

### 4-hour

If the candidate indicates they are unwilling and/or unable to prepare a project before their interview day, we tell them nothing of the challenge in advance. Instead, after they arrive, the on-site "leader(s)"

- present the "basic" / "must-have" requirements and ideas for "bonus points"
- ask the candidate to describe and discuss their design ideas
- give the candidate approximately 4 hours (including the requirements discussion) to implement the project
- a 45-60 minute presentation during which
  - the candidate demonstrates their project, discusses their design and code, _etc_.
  - the team asks questions about and beyond the project

## Considerations

These extended interviews are **expensive** in both time and money &mdash; _e.g._, travel, away from work/projects, _etc_. &mdash;
for both the **team and candidate**. The result can be **life-changing** for both the candidate and the team.

## Please

- **read** the information and comments on the candidate in [Greenhouse](https://app.greenhouse.io) &mdash; you might find something about which you want to&hellip;
  - ask the candidate
  - give constructive feedback to another interviewer
- **talk** with the candidate if/when given the opportunity
- **help** the candidate if/when needed during their on-site challenge
- **ask** meaningful questions &mdash; even if you may not be in the final de-brief, the candidate's response to your question
  may help another team member form their **strong opinion**
- **focus** when interacting with the candidate &mdash; _e.g._, please avoid "inside jokes" and conversations that may
  exclude the candidate

### Especially during the Candidate's Presentation

- **be present** &mdash; _e.g._, avoid focusing on your phone, laptop, other work, Slack, _etc_.

  "_if you can't be in the room, don't be in the room_"

- **respect** the candidate's time, effort, and pressure &mdash; even if you have seen it hundreds of times before,
the project is (hopefully!) new to them, and, perhaps, stressful
- **move on** &mdash; don't spend too much time on any one question or issue
- **learn** what the candidate does/not know

  many candidates do not want/like to say, "I don't know."

  If/when they do, please

  - **understand** how difficult it may have been for the candidate to admit that
  - **assume** you have **found the limit** of their knowledge on this topic
  - **resist** the urge to show what else you know about the topic

## When in doubt

**Remember** when **you were a candidate** and do what **you would want/hope** the team to do with/for you.
