#Greeting

Hi `<name>`, my name is Patrick and Iâ€™m part of the product engineering team at Wizeline. The interview will consists of a few minutes for me to get to know you, and then I'll have you solve a coding problem or two, depending on time. After that you'll have a chance to ask me some questions.

# Icebreaker Questions - 10 minutes

- Tell me a bit about yourself and your current role
- What kinds of things do you do you in your spare time? (gauging passion for technology)
- Tell me about your best day at work.
- How did you hear about Wizeline and what is what interests you more about it?

# Interview Problem - 45 minutes

You will have approximately 45 minutes to solve the following problem. Please feel free to use whatever language you are most comfortable with. I will be evaluating the approach you take to solve the problem, the structure of the code and your ideas, please walk me through it. You can also freely look in the internet for the language documentation. The evaluation can be done in two ways, whichever you prefer:

- You can share your screen and use your environment to solve the problem.
- Or I can share a collabedit link with you in which you will code, we cannot execute the code with this approach, but for the first one I will be expecting you to run some test cases.

_Give the prompt for the coding problem. My favorites for a first interview are:_
- [FizzBuzz](../questions/fizzbuzz.md)
- [Reverse string](../questions/reverseString.md)

_For a second interview, or if they solve the first problem very quickly, I like to build to a more complex problem, like:_
- [Reverse Words](../questions/reverseWords.md)
- [Queue](..questions/queue.md)
- [Substring](..questions/substring.md)

If they complete these quickly, cover testing:
- What basic test cases would you cover
- What testing frameworks have you used/do you currently use
- What are the important features of a test case and why is writing tests important? (Almost any answer will do here, except "I don't write tests" or "I don't think testing is important")

*NOTE:* _At the end of the interview, ask them to package and send their code if they did not proceed with Collabedit._

# Closing - 5 minutes

Ok `<name>` do you have any questions for me? ...

`<name>` thank you for your time, `<recruiter>` will be in contact with you for the follow up.
