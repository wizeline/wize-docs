#Greeting

Hi! My name is Luis Gutiérrez, I’m part of the engineering team on Wizeline and I will be conducting this interview, feel free to ask me any questions.

# Icebreaker Questions

- <name> what technologies are you passionate about?
- Tell me about your best day at work.
- How did you hear about Wizeline and what is what interests you more about it?

# Interview Problem

You will have approximately 45 minutes to solve the following problem, after that we will have a time for Q&A and closing. I will be evaluating the approach you take to solve the problem, the structure of the code and your ideas, please walk me through it. You can also freely look in the internet for the language documentation. The evaluation can be done in two ways, whichever you prefer:

- You can share your screen and use your environment to solve the problem.
- Or I can share a collabedit link with you in which you will code, we cannot execute the code with this approach, but for the first one I will be expecting you to run some test cases.

*NOTE:* _At the end of the interview, ask them to package and send their code if they did not proceed with Collabedit._

# Closing

So now you can ask about things you may want to know, this is your first time in front of a Wizeline engineer so you may have questions for me that you could not do to in the manager phone screen, feel free to ask anything.
I really like working in this company because all of us are really a team, the culture is just incredible and there is an expert for any related question you have, so if you cannot solve an impediment, you have someone just around the corner to ask. I love to learn about new technologies so that is the main reason I’m here.
<name> thank you for your time, <recruiter> will son be in contact with you for the follow up.
