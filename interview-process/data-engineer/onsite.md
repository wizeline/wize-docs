# Data Engineer Onsite
This document describes a proposal for our Data Engineer onsite.

We are looking to evaluate the following skills:
- Work with large sets of data.
- Put that data in a tool that allows queries.
- Analyze data to drive conclusions.

The proposed [datasets](http://stackoverflow.com/research) come from a Stack Overflow survey.
We will host the datasets ourselves, so the candidate does
not have direct contact with the survey website.


We want to use the onsite also to help us in our recruitment process.


## Overview
The challenge will consist of:

- 2 Easy questions
- 2 Medium questions
- 2 Hard questions
- Any number of bonus data or insights proposed by the candidate

### Process
The candidate will be given 4 hours to work on his onsite. Then, he/she will
present the results.

He/she is expected to:

1. Load data into a database
1. Process data
1. Answer the questions
1. Present results and process

Include some graphs or visualizations for presenting the results.

### Questions
Given the Stack Overflow survey dataset, we expect the candidate to answer the
following questions:

**Easy** (Pick two)

- Which is the most popular stack (set of technologies)?
- Which is the most used language in México?
- What is the average salary in México?
- What steps should we follow to improve our interview process?
- How can we be more competitive with our prospects?


**Medium**
- Which languages will be the most popular in 2017 in Mexico?
- If we need full stack developers, where should we be looking for them?

**Hard**
- What are the main influences on job satisfaction?
- Where should I create my new iOS team based on my current perks and needs?
- Given a set of users and a set of companies, find the correct match for each user, based on its characteristics and the ones of the company.

**Bonus**
Give us some insights that can be helpful for us.

### Extras
The datasets are separated by year. We plan to insert noise (erase some fields, insert invalid data, etc.)
on a dataset for one year to see how the candidate reacts to that.
