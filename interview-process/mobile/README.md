# Mobile Interview
- Usually, the mobile interview process will be two parts. After the candidate passed phone screens round, they will be invited to the remote challenge, which will ask them to build a small application.
- The Remote Challenge's goal is to determine the candidate's technical skill and knowledge in the construction of a stable and scalable mobile app.
- If qualified, the candidate will be invited to go to the Onsite Challenge, which will be held in the office. This challenge will ask them to make the extended version of the app they build in Remote Challenge. This is the last chance for the team to ask and verify their skill, knowledge, communication, and team-working abilities.
