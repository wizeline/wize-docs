Director of Security, Take Home Test
===================

As part of your interview process at Wizeline, we would like for you to help us understand what kinds of vulnerabilities are important for us to fix and be able to convey the importance of them to the interviewing team. 

In order to do that, we require that you do some homework in preparation for your next interview.

Your homework is as follows:
1. Visit app.wizeline.com
2. Create an account and inspect the application.
3. Find three or more security vulnerabilities in the application. For this, you can use any tool you need and go into any of the services that power this application.
4. Take note of the vulnerabilities and be ready to present them on your next interview. At the minimum, your vulnerability report should include: 
  * Severity: You can use your own scale here. It is important that you explain why you categorized a vulnerability on a certain severity level and what kind of attack this could provoke.
  * Likelihood: The probability of the threat being exploited.
  * Reproduction steps: If necessary, please provide steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
  * Recommended solution: Please state your recommendation and be ready to give further explanation to the team on your next interview. The recommendation should include a way to fix the vulnerability as a single instance issue or as part of a broader process or engineering practice implementation.
5. In a slide deck, present these vulnerabilities to the team and the tools/procedures you used to find them.
6. Be ready at the presentation to answer questions from the team regarding the vulnerabilities you found and the way to address them. 

Please contact security-interviews@wizeline.com if you have any questions on how to proceed with these homework.
