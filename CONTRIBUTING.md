# Contributing to Wize-Docs

- `master` is **We Agree&hellip;** &mdash; things that the team has discussed and agreed to
- The [wiki](https://github.com/wizeservices/wize-docs/wiki) is  **I Think&hellip;**
 &mdash; 'everything else'
 &mdash; _e.g._, resources, suggestions, _etc_.

| To...                                                                             | Create a branch and Pull Request | Create an Issue | Add a Comment | Modify the wiki
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-----------: | :-------------:
| propose a change to "**We Agree&hellip;**" item(s)                                | against `master`
| propose a change to someone else's proposal                                       | against their PR's branch
| suggest some kind of change is needed                                             |                                  | X

| add, suggest, or remove something that does not need to be "**We Agree&hellip;**" |                  |               |                                 | X

#### Please...
- merge a PR to `master` only when it appears that...
  - the conversation has "died down" (_e.g._, no new comments for a few days)
  - consensus has been reached
- merge 'amendment' PRs into your PR branches if/when you like the suggestions &mdash; PRs need 'consensus' only for merging into `master`
- do **not**...
  - commit directly to `master`
  - commit directly to anyone else's PR branch without discussing it with them first
    (better, perhaps, simply to propose an 'amendment' PR against their branch)
  - delete or modify anyone else's comments

## Background

As noted in the [README](README.md), using GitHub to manage team culture, practices, standards, _etc_.,
is based on this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIpNpptGX6Q)
(see the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/rkbodenner/changing-the-laws-of-engineering-with-github-pull-requests-velocity-santa-clara-2015)).

Here are the basic ideas:

- **write down** those items so that
  - new team members can **read and learn** them
  - existing team members can **refer** back to them when needed
- use git to track **changes** over time
- use GitHub Pull Requests, comments, _etc_., to
  - **propose** and **discuss** changes
  - reach **consensus** and make **decisions**
  - record **why** and **how** changes/decisions were made
