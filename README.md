# Welcome to Wize Services!

Based, in part, on this
[presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIpNpptGX6Q)
and its
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/rkbodenner/changing-the-laws-of-engineering-with-github-pull-requests-velocity-santa-clara-2015), we maintain the documents in this repo to help team members understand...

- what we do
- how we do it &mdash; _e.g._, practices, standards, tools, _etc_.
- why/how we got here &mdash; via commit history, Pull Requests & comments, _etc_.

Please read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information;
watch this repo

![watch this repo](images/watch-repo.png)

to be notified of conversations, proposals, _etc_. via e-mail so you can
decide if/when you wish to participate!

### Repo _vs_ Wiki
As described in the presentation & slides linked above, things in the **repo** are cultural 'norms', standards,
and practices; things which deserve and require discussion and agreement to change &mdash; 'Law', if you like.

In contrast, the [wiki](https://github.com/wizeservices/wize-docs/wiki) is a great place to collect and share ideas, resources, _etc_., which do not require/deserve discussion and agreement.

Please add and maintain information in the wiki, adding and editing pages as needed!

## Sections
- [Development practices](development/README.md)
- [Interviewing/Hiring](interview-process/README.md)
- [Onboarding](onboarding.md)

## Your success is part of our success!

### If you're just starting with us
Please read through these files/documents.

Just as importantly, *please* help us improve them. **Right now**, you are our **best expert** on being a new-hire.

If you have any questions *please*
- ask someone
- create a branch and submit a Pull Request (PR) with your improvement(s)

Your changes will help future new-hires (and all of us!) be more successful more quickly!

### Even if you have been with us for "a while"
Please refer back to these documents on a regular basis and help **keep them up-to-date**.
- add new information, practices, standards, _etc_.
- update things we've changed
- remove things that aren't relevant any more

If you're not sure, ask other team members &mdash; we're all in this together!
