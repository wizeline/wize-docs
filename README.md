# Welcome to Wize Services!

We maintain the documents in this repo to help everyone understand what we do and how we do it:
- practices
- standards
- _etc_.

## Your success is part of our success!

### If you're just starting with us
Please read through these files/documents.

Just as importantly, *please* help us improve them. **Right now**, you are our **best expert** on being a new-hire.

If you have any questions *please*
- ask someone
- create a branch and submit a Pull Request (PR) with your improvement(s)

Your changes will help future new-hires (and all of us!) be more successful more quickly!

### Even if you have been with us for "a while"
Please refer back to these documents on a regular basis and help **keep them up-to-date**.
- add new information, practices, standards, _etc_.
- update things we've changed
- remove things that aren't relevant any more

If you're not sure, ask other team members &mdash; we're all in this together!
