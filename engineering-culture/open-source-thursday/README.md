Open Source Thursday
====================

At Wizeline we use open source all the time. We love it so much that some Wizeliners like to contribute to open source projects as much as they can. That is why we gather every Thursday to share our contributions to the open source world.

Everyone is welcome to Open Source Thursday. Even if you are just curious about contributing to open source. We want to foster more contribution and by inviting more new comers we will achieve our goal.

Let's do more for open source!

**Open Source Thursday** (OST for short) stands as a group of Wizeliners that are enthusiastic about anything open source.

How does OST work? 
------------------
You can work alone but it is far more fun to work as a team. A team starts with at least two people so pair up or get more buddies together and start contributing to any open source project you may like.

Every Thursday, we will get together to share our contributions to open source projects. It will  be a good way to get encouraged and do more as well as get a perspective on what kind of contributions others are doing.
