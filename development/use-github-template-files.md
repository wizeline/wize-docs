# Use GitHub Template files

If, like most projects, you keep your project repo(s) on [GitHub](https://github.com), provide templates for Pull Requests and Issues.

## TL;DR
- Create template Markdown files
- GitHub will auto-populate new Issues and/or Pull Requests with them

## Details
- GitHub's [blog post](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) announcing them
- GitHub help
	- [Issue templates](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository/)
	- [Pull request templates](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/)

Here's a [humble example](https://github.com/wizeservices/wize-docs/blob/master/development/git-contributing-guidelines.md#body) of a simple PR template.

## When to Use
### Internal Projects: Required
Exceptions are possible, but quite rare.

Have a _really good_ reason to justify being an exception.

No, really &mdash; not good enough &mdash; use them.

### Client Projects: Highly Recommended
If your client doesn't already have & use these, "raise the bar" by suggesting them.
