# Pod Leads Position Overview


### About Pod Leads

A Pod Lead is the role within a project which becomes the main technical point of contact for the client. They are designated to a single project, and having someone leading one project does not mean that they will necessarily take on this role for subsequent projects.

A Pod Leader serves as an ambassador of our Wizeline (and in particular our Services) culture who,
- Focuses on driving wins for the client.
- Communicates early and often. Is proactive with communication, especially with “bad” news.
- Celebrates success. Empowers the team and allows for others to take credit.
- Speaks up, documents, and learns when issues arise.

Has experience and demonstrates a clear mastery of skills for Individual Contributors and also drives the execution of the project:
- Responsible for the execution of work by the team. But delegates and allows other team members to own part of the development process.
- Works closely with Project Managers and Client on agreements and communications. Fills in for PjMs if at times they are not available.
- Leads a team in Technical decision making. Organizes, does not dictate.
- Leads Agile practices, stand-ups, JIRA etc.
- Knows the skills of the team members to organize the work more effectively and helps the project manager and the account manager understand where there are areas to improve.
- Understands the client strategy and can adjust priorities based on business needs.
- Prepares leaders on the team who can take on the pod lead role as new needs emerge.

### Considerations

Taking on the role of a Pod Lead does not mean a promotion or change in job title or salary.

### Considerations Regarding the Engineering Ladder

- A Pod Lead must be, at the least, an IC2 engineering.
- Being a Pod Lead does not mean to be an IC3 engineering or E3 banding.

### Process to Become a Pod Lead

At Wizeline, we believe in emergent leadership. When our engineers demonstrate leadership skills while working with clients, we work with them to provide with the opportunity to become a Pod Lead. The Engineering Manager and the Project Managers work on designating the leads for each pod based on the qualities demonstrated with the team.

To learn more about what is expected from the role, or, to enroll on the leadership and management training, please reach out to your manager.

### Pod Lead Interactions with Other Roles

- Project Manager

  The Project Manager works with the Pod Lead to define and implement the appropriate project management practices for the project. The Project Manager is also an enabler for the Pod Lead to reach out for guidance, help, and answers. The Project Manager can also assist the Pod Lead on prioritization, interaction with other teams, and communication strategies.

- Technical Writer

  The Pod Lead and Project Manager should identify areas where the support of documentation is needed to drive adoption of the technology being developed.The Pod Lead must highlight those opportunities for the Project Manager to include them on the plan and loop in the Technical Writer on relevant engagements with the client.

- UX Designer

  The Pod Lead works very closely with the lead UX Designer on identifying opportunities for UX and UI design in the project, as well as how to bring the best user-centered design processes to the customer who may not yet execute best UX practices. The Pod Lead ensures that the UX Designer understands the priorities and timelines of the project.

- Account Manager

  The Account Manager is responsible for everything that is being developed for the client. The Pod Lead should reach out to the Account Manager if they need insight into the client stakeholders and/or are running into blockers when engaging with the client. The Account Manager serves as a resource to support the Pod Lead to ensure that the team (pod) we’ve built is the right fit for the project.
